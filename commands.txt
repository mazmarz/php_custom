# First you need to create the repository on git.  You can't do this with "git"; eventually you can use the github api; simpler use the web page

echo "# php_custom" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mazmarz/php_custom.git
git push -u origin master


# These command work perfectly and are actually on the website
